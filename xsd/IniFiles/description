The <Ini> inner element MUST refer to a text file containing sections and key-value pairs in the following format.

  
 [sectionA]
 key=string
  
 [sectionB]
 key=string
 key=string
  
The file structure is documented as part of the primary application programming interface (API) call GetProfileString that is used to read .ini files (for more information see [MSDN-GetProfString]).
