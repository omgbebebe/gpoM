The <DataSource> inner element describes a single ODBC data source. An ODBC DataSource is a set of attributes that point to a database or data provider. Each ODBC driver implements a standard set of attributes and can provide additional attributes on a driver-specific basis. These are driver-specific settings and ODBC drivers are available for a number of platforms. For more information on ODBC, see [MSDN-ODBC].
