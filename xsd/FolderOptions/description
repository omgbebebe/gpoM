The Folder Options outer element is a container for operations related to the client's desktop and shell. Four different inner elements are defined. The FolderOptions preference type encompasses three different types of preferences:

FolderOptions: Controls attributes of the desktop and shell.

FileTypes: Associates applications with a given file extension.

OpenWith: Defines the default application associated with a given file extension.

Two types of Folder Options are defined in elements GlobalFolderOptions and GlobalFolderOptionsVista. A client SHOULD support both sets of settings.
