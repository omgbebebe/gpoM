The Application element allows third-party extensibility. For example, a third-party developer could combine a number of Registry settings into one Application element in order to apply policy to a third-party application. See [MSDN-APPSNAPIN]. There is no administrative tool plug-in that defines an Application element. A third-party developer extends the administrative tool plug-in to load and save application settings. See [MSDN-PROPSHEETEXTS] and [MSDN-APPSNAPIN]. An application created by a third-party MUST generate a unique extId attribute and save it with the Application element to facilitate loading the appropriate administrative tool plug-in extension.

The Application element MUST contain zero or more Preferences Policy Messages as defined in sections 2.2.1.2 through 2.2.1.22. An Application element containing zero Preferences Policy Messages will not invoke any Preferences Client-side extensions. The Application Client-side extension does no specific processing, instead delegating based on the embedded Preferences Policy Messages. The Application Client-side extension invokes the Preferences Client-side extension specific to the embedded Preferences Policy Messages. For example, the sample message in section 4.2.22 shows a single Application that contains a Registry Preferences Policy Message setting a Registry value.
