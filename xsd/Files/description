The <File> inner element represents a request to modify or copy one or more files. The source and destination paths can refer to a file system on the client, or to a network path in UNC format. The <Files> preference type aids in managing files on a client. Files can be copied, deleted, or renamed, or their attributes can be changed. For more information on files and their attributes, see [MSDN-FILEMGMT].
