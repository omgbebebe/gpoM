Targeting criteria can be added to any element and allow a granular selection beyond the user or computer. For each element that has targeting criteria, the result of each targeting item can be treated as a Boolean (true or false) value. The protocol will process this element if the final evaluation of all targeting criteria is true. For the targeting criteria listed in this section, return values are used with zero mapping to true and 1 mapping to false.
